<p>
An API for loading and using configuration files, see <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/">the project site</a>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
Typically you would load configuration with a static method from {@link ConfigFactory} and then use
it with methods in the {@link Config} interface. Configuration may be in the form of JSON files,
Java properties, or <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON files</a>; you may also
build your own configuration in code or from your own file formats.
</p>

<p>
An application can simply call {@link ConfigFactory#load()} and place
its configuration in "application.conf" on the classpath.
If you use the default configuration from {@link ConfigFactory#load()}
there's no need to pass a configuration to your libraries
and frameworks, as long as they all default to this same default, which they should.
<br/><strong>Example application code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/java/simple-app/src/main">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/scala/simple-app/src/main">Scala</a>.
<br/>Showing a couple of more special-purpose features, <strong>a more complex example:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/java/complex-app/src/main">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/scala/complex-app/src/main">Scala</a>.
</p>

<p>
A library or framework should ship a file "reference.conf" in its jar, and allow an application to pass in a
{@link Config} to be used for the library. If no {@link Config} is provided,
call {@link ConfigFactory#load()}
to get the default one. Typically a library might offer two constructors, one with a <code>Config</code> parameter
and one which uses {@link ConfigFactory#load()}.
<br/><strong>Example library code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/java/simple-lib/src/main">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/tree/master/examples/scala/simple-lib/src/main">Scala</a>.

	<li>If you want to use <code>.conf</code> files in addition to <code>.json</code> and <code>.properties</code>,
	see the <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for some short examples
	and the full <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON spec</a> for the long version.</li>
